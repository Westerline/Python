# Python Tools Repository

* This repository is a collection of tool-oriented Python scripts. These tools are meant to perform one or two simple tasks. For more complex sequences, you can mix and match tools.

## Getting Started

* Download the repository and unzip the files to your preferred destination. For more complex sequences, create a caller script with any proprietary data you require. Then call the tools you need for your task. Mix and match the tools you use to tackle different tasks.

### Disclaimer
Please test these tools thoroughly in your own environment before deploying them to a production environment. I have tested these tools in my own environment, but I cannot garuntee their effectiveness and/or safety in yours.

### Prerequisites

* Python version 3.6 or higher
* Virtual Machine Environment for Testing (Optional)
* Text Editor with Syntax Highlighting Such as Notepad++ (Optional)

### Coding/Indentation Style

* Any comments should be located towards the top of the document. These comments should focus on items which aren't included in Python's help system.
* Comments should be written as complete sentences.
* The first letter of commands should be capitalized
* K&R is the prefered indentation style, refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&R_style for more details.
